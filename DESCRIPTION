Description: Character vector to numerical translation in Euros from Spanish
    spelled monetary quantities. Text must be previously cleaned & removed
    extraneous words, symbols or cents. Quantities MUST be written in a correct
    Spanish cause this isn't a grammar tool. Upper limit is up to the millions
    range.
    Geocoding from cadastral reference number. Source data must be a valid
    cadastral reference or downloaded KML files from Spanish Cadastral website.
    Be careful geocoding many items. You will be banned if many request
    are issued in a short period of time. geocode_cadastral() waits 2 seconds
    between requests to avoid this issue.
